##What is this?
This is a portfolio of past work that I have done myself or contributed to.
Below is a brief explaination of each entry, what it is, when it was made, and why.

##Comprehensive
This was the comprehensive assignment for CS2420 which was completed by myself and a classmate
as the last assingment of the semester. We were instructed to create two implementations of
the disjoint set ADT, one which we had discussed in class, and one of our own design. Unlike
past assignments, we would also not be provided any files with a start to them and would have
to do everything ourselves.
